# EventTrackerProject

## Overview
I created a database to hold basic information about old pets my family and I have had. 

## Description
Populate a table with an auto-incremental ID, a pet's name, type, a brief description, the span of time we had them (in years) and eventually to include an image of each of them.

## Technologies Used
JPA
Spring Boot
Java
Javascript
JSON
CSS
HTML
Postman
Gradle
Spring Tool Suite/Eclipse
Sublime
Mamp
Github
REST APIs
AJAX

## Lessons Learned
* Dynamically build a table to show and manipulate data

* Using Javascript/JSON to parse incoming/user data, route it through the service/impl/controller, then back to user/website again

* To use event listeners as triggers for certain functions

* To block certain forms, data, etc from showing until events

## TODOs 
* Fix Update 

* Fill out Delete function to call/display friend data, confirm deletion and auto-repopulate the table

* Mine Bootstrap and CSS to beautify the website

* Further fill out DB, including imgs
